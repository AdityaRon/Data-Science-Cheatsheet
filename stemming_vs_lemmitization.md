Lemmatization and stemming are both techniques used in **text preprocessing** to reduce words to their base or root form, but they differ in how they achieve this.

### **1. Stemming:**
   - **Method**: Stemming is a crude technique that cuts off the ends of words to reduce them to their root forms, often by removing common suffixes like *-ing*, *-ed*, *-ly*, etc.
   - **Output**: The output of stemming may not always be a valid word; for example, "running" might be reduced to "run," but "better" might be stemmed to "bett."
   - **Algorithm**: Common stemming algorithms include **Porter Stemmer** and **Snowball Stemmer**, which apply a set of rules to trim down words.
   - **Speed**: Itâ€™s computationally faster than lemmatization, but the results are less accurate because it doesn't consider the context of the word.

### **2. Lemmatization:**
   - **Method**: Lemmatization reduces words to their **lemma**, which is the base or dictionary form of a word. It uses **morphological analysis** and context (like part of speech) to return meaningful base forms.
   - **Output**: The output of lemmatization is a valid word. For instance, "running" would be reduced to "run" as a verb, but "better" would be reduced to "good" based on its meaning as an adjective.
   - **Tools**: Lemmatization requires linguistic knowledge, typically leveraging libraries like **WordNet**.
   - **Accuracy**: It is more accurate than stemming, but slower due to the complexity of checking the word's part of speech and context.

### **Key Differences:**
   - **Precision**: Lemmatization is more accurate, producing valid base forms, while stemming is faster but more approximate.
   - **Context Awareness**: Lemmatization considers word context (e.g., part of speech), while stemming applies a fixed set of rules without context.
   - **Use Cases**: Stemming is useful when speed is crucial, and small errors in word forms are acceptable, whereas lemmatization is preferable in applications requiring precision, such as machine translation or information retrieval.

In summary, **stemming** is faster but less sophisticated, while **lemmatization** provides better, context-aware results at the cost of additional computational effort.
